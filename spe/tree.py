class Tree(AdaptiveLinearSmoother, DecisionTreeRegressor):
    """A decision tree regressor.

    Usual regression tree that is additionally a subclass of
    :class:`~spe.tree.AdaptiveLinearSmoother`.

    Documentation is heavily lifted from :class:`~sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor` 
    class, which this class inherits from.

    Parameters
    ----------
    criterion : {"squared_error", "friedman_mse", "absolute_error", \
            "poisson"}, default="squared_error"
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "squared_error" for the mean squared error, which is equal to
        variance reduction as feature selection criterion and minimizes the L2
        loss using the mean of each terminal node, "friedman_mse", which uses
        mean squared error with Friedman's improvement score for potential
        splits, "absolute_error" for the mean absolute error, which minimizes
        the L1 loss using the median of each terminal node, and "poisson" which
        uses reduction in Poisson deviance to find splits.

    splitter : {"best", "random"}, default="best"
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
        strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to choose
        the best random split.

    max_depth : int, default=None
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int or float, default=2
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

    min_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
        A split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at
        least ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and
        right branches.  This may have the effect of smoothing the model,
        especially in regression.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.

    min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0
        The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all
        the input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have
        equal weight when sample_weight is not provided.

    max_features : int, float or {"sqrt", "log2"}, default=None
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and
          `max(1, int(max_features * n_features_in_))` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.

        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        Controls the randomness of the estimator. The features are always
        randomly permuted at each split, even if ``splitter`` is set to
        ``"best"``. When ``max_features < n_features``, the algorithm will
        select ``max_features`` at random at each split before finding the best
        split among them. But the best found split may vary across different
        runs, even if ``max_features=n_features``. That is the case, if the
        improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and one
        split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic behaviour
        during fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed to an integer.

    max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None
        Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0
        A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity
        greater than or equal to this value.

        The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::

            N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity
                                - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)

        where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of
        samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the
        left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.

        ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,
        if ``sample_weight`` is passed.

    ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0
        Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The
        subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than
        ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed.

    monotonic_cst : array-like of int of shape (n_features), default=None
        Indicates the monotonicity constraint to enforce on each feature.
          - 1: monotonic increase
          - 0: no constraint
          - -1: monotonic decrease

        If monotonic_cst is None, no constraints are applied.

        Monotonicity constraints are not supported for:
          - multioutput regressions (i.e. when `n_outputs_ > 1`),
          - regressions trained on data with missing values.

    Attributes
    ----------
    feature_importances_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,)
        The feature importances.
        The higher, the more important the feature.
        The importance of a feature is computed as the
        (normalized) total reduction of the criterion brought
        by that feature. It is also known as the Gini importance [4]_.

        Warning: impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for
        high cardinality features (many unique values). See
        :func:`sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance` as an alternative.

    max_features_ : int
        The inferred value of max_features.

    n_features_in_ : int
        Number of features seen during ``fit``.

    feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
        Names of features seen during ``fit``. Defined only when `X`
        has feature names that are all strings.

    n_outputs_ : int
        The number of outputs when ``fit`` is performed.

    tree_ : Tree instance
        The underlying Tree object. Please refer to
        ``help(sklearn.tree._tree.Tree)`` for attributes of Tree object and
        :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_tree_plot_unveil_tree_structure.py`
        for basic usage of these attributes.

    Notes
    -----
    The default values for the parameters controlling the size of the trees
    (e.g. ``max_depth``, ``min_samples_leaf``, etc.) lead to fully grown and
    unpruned trees which can potentially be very large on some data sets. To
    reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be
    controlled by setting those parameter values.
